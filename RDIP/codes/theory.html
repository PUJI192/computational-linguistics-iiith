	<h2>Theory</h2>
	<p>A clause typically contains a subject noun phrase and a finite verb. Some languages allow subjects to be omitted. There are two types of subclauses:</p>
<p>1.independent clause</p>
<p>2.subordinate clause</p>
<p>Independent clause shows the complete meaning in it. For example: Ram eats. A subordinate clause is not a complete sentence. For example: because I am sick. Sentences can also be classified on the basis of clauses.</p>

<p>Classification on the basis of clauses are:</p>
<p>1.A simple sentence consists of only one independent clause. There are no subordinate clauses.</p>
<p>2.A compound sentence consists of more than one independent clauses joined ny conjunctions or punctuations. There are no subordinate clauses.</p>
<p>3.A complex sentence consists of atleast one indpendent clause and a single subordinate clause</p>
<p>4.A complex-compoundssentence consists of more than one independent clauses and atleast one of the independent clauses has one or more than one subordinate clauses.</p>
